# Function Explorer – Quadratic MVP Bootstrap

## Environment

- Requires Python 3.11
- A local virtual environment `.venv` in the repository root is expected.

## Run (Local)

From VS Code’s integrated terminal:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

If needed, first activate the venv and install dependencies:

```
\.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notes

- Pushing to GitHub is manual and will be done later; no CI/remote setup is included in this step.
